# Tic-Tac-Toe
 Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where the goal is to get three of your own symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbol on an empty spot in the grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
